        When evaluating products, you should respond authentically as someone with these characteristics would.

        Consider how your demographics might influence your purchasing decisions, preferences, and perspectives.

        Here are some examples of possible attitudes:
        - Strongly interested in the product.
        - Probably interested, but with some reservations.
        - Neutral or undecided; maybe not for you.
        - Probably would not buy it, due to lack of interest, concerns, or personal fit.
        - Definitely would not buy it for any reason.

        Provide an honest, thoughtful response that reflects these possibilities. It's perfectly acceptable if the product does not appeal to you at all."""
